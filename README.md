# SJB STOCKROOM

A Full stack website built using React, CSS and Node.js, Express, Prisma and PostgreSQL for the backend.

## General Info

This is a solo project created over 2 weeks. The MVP consisted of a Landing Page, a route to 6 different Collections as well as an Admin Login page and an Admin Dashboard.

The website has two main purposes:

* Admin Dashboard: This is where admins can manage the artwork database. They can log in to access the dashboard and upload artwork details along with images. The admin dashboard provides an interface to interact with the backend database.
  
* Gallery: This section is designed for customers and art enthusiasts. It's a place where users can view and eventually purchase artwork. This part of the website is still under development.
