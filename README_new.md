# SJB STOCKROOM

The website has two main purposes:

* Admin Dashboard: This is where admins can manage the artwork database. They can log in to access the dashboard and upload artwork details along with images. The admin dashboard provides an interface to interact with the backend database.
  
* Gallery: This section is designed for customers and art enthusiasts. It's a place where users can view and eventually purchase artwork. This part of the website is still under development.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
